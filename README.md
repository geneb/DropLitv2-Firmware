This firmware is based on SeeMeCNC's fork of Repetier Firmware.  It's been modified to work /only/
with the SeeMeCNC DropLit v2 resin printer.  While the defines in Configuration.h can be changed
to other printer models, it is highly likely that the firmware won't work on those other printers
due to the rather ham-fisted methods used to ensure operation with the DropLit v2.

The only thing this software is guaranteed to do is occupy disk space.  It "works for me". :)
